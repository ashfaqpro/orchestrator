<h2>Key Management and Application Discovery</h2>
<p>
Let Orchestrator take the responsibility of managing your instance keys. Discover processes and applications running on the instances. Discover connections between instances.</p>

<ul>
<li>Key management of a large cloud deployment can be a tedious task for any devops user. Orchestator aims to provide a simple and secure way of managing all the instance keys once uploaded into the system.</li>
<li>Once instance keys are known to Orchestrator, it can perform process and application discovery on the instances. Virtual tags are added to the instances with the discovered application or process information.</li>
<li>Active network connections (incoming or outgoing) between instances are also discovered 
</li>
</ul>
